This is the blog for the OCaml Platform project.
The following is how we write and publish posts.

1. All work is done on this one repo, so avoid making forks. Only contributors have push access.
2. Each blog post gets its own branch
3. Please use 'sensible' line breaks (see note below)
4. Once a draft is ready for review, submit a **PR** to `master`.
5. Other folks can comment on the PR using the GitHub interface.
6. Ideally only *one person* incorporates the feedback and pushes changes
7. If anyone else really needs to push changes, make it *very* clear in the comments that you are about to do so *and* when you are done.
8. Last person to review will note this in the comments, make final edits and merge.

****

When we say 'sensible line breaks', please use your judgement.
We're specifically trying to **avoid** the following problems:

- *Paragraphs per line*: This makes it difficult to point out specific changes and comments begin to overlap.
- *People re-doing the line breaks*: Unless done as a separate commit, changes become difficult to read between diffs.
